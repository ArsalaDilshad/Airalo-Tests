   * Searches for and verifies the details of the Japan eSIM package on the Airalo website.
   * 
   * This test performs a series of automated interactions on the Airalo homepage to 
   * verify the details of the eSIM package for Japan. It navigates to the website, 
   * accepts privacy notices, allows notifications, changes the currency, and selects 
   * the Japan eSIM package. After selecting the package, it retrieves relevant details 
   * such as the package title, coverage, data, validity, and price. Each retrieved detail 
   * is then compared against expected values using assertions. 
   * 
   * If any assertions fail, a corresponding error message is collected and reported 
   * at the end of the test run, allowing for a "soft assertion" approach where 
   * multiple assertion failures can be documented in a single test execution.
   * 
   * @param {object} context - The test execution context provided by the testing framework.
   * @param {Page} context.page - The Playwright page object used for interacting with the browser.
   * 
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if any assertions fail, detailing the failed assertions.
