# Airalo-Tests
This project is a Playwright-based testing suite designed to evaluate and verify the functionality of Airalo Application. Playwright, a Node.js library for browser and API automation, enables reliable and efficient testing of web applications across multiple browsers, as well as API interactions. By leveraging Playwright, this suite ensures thorough and consistent testing coverage for Airalo Package Selection, promoting functionality and stability across various environments.

## Features

- **Web Automation**: Automated Web tests for eSim package selection.

- **Hooks**: The test.beforeAll hook is a setup function that runs once before all the tests in the suite. Its purpose is to establish a new request context using Playwright's API, and it handles authentication by obtaining an access token.

- **API Tests Automation**: Using playwright, API tests for Get eSIM List and Submit Order are automated


## Installation
```bash
# Install NodeJs and npm
 Windows : https://nodejs.org/en 
 macOS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Airalo Assignment

# Install dependencies
npm install
```
## Configuration
The Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.js) is located in the root directory. Customize it according to your needs. For example, you can configure test execution mode, browsers, set base URL.

## Tech Stack
This project uses the following technologies and tools:

### 1. **Playwright**
- **Description**: A Node.js library for browser automation [Playwirght Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)
- **Usage**: Allows end-to-end testing by interacting with browsers programmatically.

### 2. **Javascript**
- **Description**:   JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used for client-side scripting in web development. 
- **Usage**: 
In this project, JavaScript serves several key roles:
  - **Test Scripting**: JavaScript is used to write test scripts for automating interactions with the web application. This includes actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying page content.
  - **Integration with Playwright**: Playwright, a Node.js library for browser automation, relies on JavaScript to define and execute tests. 
  - **Asynchronous Operations**: JavaScript's support for promises and async/await syntax allows for handling asynchronous operations in a clean and manageable way. This is crucial for interacting with web elements that might load or change dynamically.
  
  ## Design Pattern
  For organizing and maintaining code, making it more readable, reusable, and easier to manag the Page Object Model (POM) a design pattern is used in this project.This design creates a layer of abstraction between the test scripts and the applicationâ€™s user interface. For further details, please refer to the [Playwirght Documentation for POM](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)
  Here in this screenshot, you can see that home page objects and functions class is created in pages folder and the relevant test of this class are added in the test folder.

 ## Naming Conventions
#### Lower Camel Case:
Used for variables, functions
#### Upper Camel Case : 
Used for Classes
#### Snake Case:
Used for project files

 ## Test Execution
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Airalo Assignment

# Add client id and secret values to constant.js file
```

```bash
# to execute the Web test in headless mode
In the playwright.config.ts file check browser property  headless: true,

# to execute the Web test in UI mode
In the playwright.config.ts file check browser property  headless: false,

# execute command
npx playwright test

 ## Test Results
 Test results are shown in a default html report that is configured in the playwright.config.ts file
 ```bash
# to view the result report
 npx playwright show-report
```
